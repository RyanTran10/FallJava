So this is where I stand
Between hell and heaven's end
With each step I take a chance
Don't know which way I'll end

We're at the point of no return
A prison I will burn
My arms are open wide
I've got no fear
As long as you are near
I'm calling you my dear

Come walk the line with me
For you I'd win it all
Or lose everything
We can find the balance inbetween
If we walk the line
Oooh-ooh
If we walk the line

If we walk the line

Nothing comes easily
We're running from the fire
Beneath our feet

The answer is in our reach
Together we'll take the heat

We're at the point of no return
A prison I will burn
My arms are open wide
I've got no fear
As long as you are near
I'm calling you my dear

Come walk the line with me
For you I'd win it all
Or lose everything
We can find the balance inbetween
If we walk the line
Oooh-ooh
If we walk the line

If we walk the line

If we walk the line

If we walk the line

Caught in the middle of dark and light
I'll never let you go
We'll make it to heaven
But we have to try
We're not far away from home

Come walk the line with me
For you I'd win it all
Or lose everything
We can find the balance inbetween
If we walk the line
Oooh-ooh
If we walk the line
